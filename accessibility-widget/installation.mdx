## Installation Methods

The Accessibility Widget can be installed in several ways depending on your platform and needs.

## Method 1: NPM Package (Recommended)

Install the widget as an npm package for maximum flexibility:

```bash
npm install accessibility-widget
```

Then import and initialize in your JavaScript:

```javascript
import { WidgetInitializer } from 'accessibility-widget';
import { pluginConfig } from 'accessibility-widget/config';

WidgetInitializer.init(pluginConfig);
```

## Method 2: CDN (Quick Setup)

Add the widget using a CDN link in your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your content -->
  
  <!-- Accessibility Widget -->
  <script>
    window._clvA11yConfig = {
      iconId: "accessibility",
      iconSize: 48,
      language: "en",
      position: {
        mobile: "bottom-right",
        desktop: "bottom-right"
      },
      theme: {
        primaryColor: "#1a1a1a",
        textColor: "#212529"
      }
    };
  </script>
  <script src="https://cdn.webyes.com/widget.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Method 3: Shopify Integration

For Shopify stores, use the Liquid block:

```liquid
{% render 'accessibility-widget' %}
```

The widget will automatically read configuration from your Shopify app metafields.

  See the [Shopify Integration Guide](/accessibility-widget/integration/shopify) for detailed setup instructions.

## Method 4: WordPress Plugin

If you're using WordPress, install the OneTap Pro Accessibility Plugin:

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin panel
3. Configure settings in the plugin admin page

<Info>
  See the [WordPress Integration Guide](/accessibility-widget/integration/wordpress) for more details.

## Method 5: Custom Integration

For custom implementations, include the built JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="path/to/widget.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Configure before initialization
  window._clvA11yConfig = {
    // Your configuration
  };
</script>
```

The widget will automatically initialize when the script loads.

## Build from Source

If you want to build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/webyes/accessibility-widget.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.
