## Shopify App Installation

The Accessibility Widget is available as a Shopify app that can be easily installed and enabled through Theme App Embed. This is the recommended and only supported installation method.

## Step 1: Install the App

1. **Go to Shopify App Store**
   - Navigate to the Shopify App Store
   - Search for "WebYes Accessibility Widget" or "OneTap Pro Accessibility"
   - Click **Add app** to install

2. **Approve Permissions**
   - Review the app permissions
   - Click **Install app** to proceed

3. **Complete Installation**
   - Wait for the installation to complete
   - You'll be redirected to the app dashboard

## Step 2: Enable Theme App Embed

The widget is installed as a **Theme App Embed**, which means it can be enabled directly from your theme customizer without modifying code.

### Enable via Theme Customizer

1. **Open Theme Customizer**
   - Go to **Online Store** > **Themes** in your Shopify admin
   - Click **Customize** on your active theme

2. **Navigate to App Embeds**
   - In the theme customizer, look for **App embeds** in the left sidebar
   - Or go to **Theme settings** > **App embeds**

3. **Enable the Widget**
   - Find **Accessibility Widget** or **OneTap Pro Accessibility** in the list
   - Toggle it **ON** to enable
   - The widget will immediately appear on your storefront

4. **Save Changes**
   - Click **Save** in the top right corner
   - The widget is now live on your store

<Info>
  Theme App Embeds allow apps to add functionality to your store without requiring code changes. The widget will automatically appear on all pages where app embeds are enabled.
</Info>

## Step 3: Configure the Widget

Configure the widget settings through the app dashboard:

1. **Access App Settings**
   - Go to **Apps** in your Shopify admin
   - Click on **Accessibility Widget** or **OneTap Pro Accessibility**

2. **Configure Options**
   - **Icon Settings**: Choose widget icon and size
   - **Position**: Set widget position for mobile and desktop
   - **Language**: Select default language
   - **Features**: Enable/disable specific accessibility features
   - **Profiles**: Enable/disable accessibility profiles
   - **Theme**: Customize widget colors to match your store

3. **Save Configuration**
   - Click **Save** to apply changes
   - Changes take effect immediately

## Configuration via App Metafields

The widget automatically reads configuration from Shopify app metafields. The app handles this automatically, but you can verify the configuration in your theme's Liquid code:

```liquid
{% assign app_data = app.metafields.widget.settings %}
{% if app_data %}
  <script>
    window._clvA11yConfig = {{ app_data }};
  </script>
{% endif %}
```

<Info>
  The app automatically manages metafields. You typically don't need to modify this code manually.
</Info>

## Verification

After installation and enabling the app embed:

1. **Check Your Storefront**
   - Visit your storefront
   - Look for the accessibility widget icon (usually in the bottom-right corner)

2. **Test the Widget**
   - Click the widget icon to open it
   - Verify all features are accessible
   - Test different accessibility profiles

3. **Mobile Testing**
   - Check the widget on mobile devices
   - Verify positioning and functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Not Appearing

- **Check App Embed Status**: Ensure the app embed is enabled in theme customizer
- **Clear Cache**: Clear your browser cache and Shopify theme cache
- **Check App Status**: Verify the app is installed and active in **Apps** section
- **Theme Compatibility**: Some themes may require additional configuration

### Configuration Not Working

- **App Settings**: Verify settings are saved in the app dashboard
- **Metafields**: Check that app metafields are properly set
- **Theme Refresh**: Try refreshing the theme customizer
